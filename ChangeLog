- Completely change the low level sub-part access, using now the start, count and map
  argument as in NetCDF (with small modifications). This has been required to be able
  to have sub access on every dimensions, not only the last and to have access to
  part of one dimension (not only one element or the all set of elements of one
  dimension). With the map attribute, it will be possible to swap dimensions
  on the fly when reading or writing.
- change the status of the main group in the group level access. The main group is now part
  of the etsf_groups folder as others. When defining, it is still possible to choose one
  or several variables of this main group.
- add partial support for the units attribute (writing is done with default values and 
  reading only load the values but do nothing with them) and the k_dependant attribute
  for number_of_coefficients and number_of_states.
- correct a bug in the implementation while still using the old number_of_symmetries
  dimension.

* Fri Nov 17 2006 Damien Caliste <caliste@pcpm.ucl.ac.be> 0.4
- create a type for variables that can have a partial access. Update the code
  routine to cope with this new type.
- upgrade the documentation by using sections and subsections.
- correct a bug when using sub access on low level.

* Mon Nov 13 2006 Damien Caliste <caliste@pcpm.ucl.ac.be> 0.3
- import the group level scripts of Yann Pouillon to build a high level API
  on the ETSF specifications.
- modify then to use the unformatted shape for the main data in the ETSF specs.
- make the group level routines use the low level ones (guaranteeing dimension
  checks).
- add default values in the etsf_io structure and add the consistency checks in calls.

* Mon Nov 06 2006 Damien Caliste <caliste@pcpm.ucl.ac.be> 0.2
- modify the low level API to allow to use different (but compatible) shapes
  for variables.
- add the capability to address only part of variables.
- create a generic type of pointers to be able to use the library without
  dupplicating data in memory and access same data with the same high level
  routine but with an unformatted shape array.

* Thu Nov 02 2006 Damien Caliste <caliste@pcpm.ucl.ac.be> 0.1
- basic read/write low level API in Fortran90.
- put library under the LGPL, waiting for global discussion on the future licence.
- initial API documentation using ROBODoc.
