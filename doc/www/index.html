    <h1>What is it?</h1>
    <p>TODO: Put some description here</p>
    <h1>License</h1>
    <p>The library and all its contents (source files and documentation files) is released under the Lesser General Public License as it can be found the <a href="../../COPYING">COPYING file</a> of the distribution.</p>
    <h1>Contents of this documentation</h1>
    <p>The documentation of the library is made of two parts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One appropriated for beginners who would like to know how to read and write some ETSF files using this library. See the <a href="tutorials/index.html">tutorials pages</a>. Several examples are explained step by step.</li>
      <li>The other is the description of all public routines that can be used. Their functions, their arguments and some examples are given, as much as the code itself when relevant.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The libraries</h2>
    <p>ETSF_IO is shipped with several libraries. These libraries gives from low-level access to high-level routines on ETSF files. Each library contains one or several modules, as described below.</p>
    <h3>etsf_io_low_level (<em>libetsf_io_low_level.a</em>)</h3>
    <p>The library is made of one unique module. This is a wrapper around NetCDF calls to be able to do in one call what requires several NetCDF calls, such as get the id of a variable, check its shape and dimensions definition and read it. This module is not specific to the ETSF specifications and can be used as a stand-alone library to easily handle NetCDF files.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tutorials/mix_ETSF_and_non_ETSF_f90.html">Tutorial 5</a> is not focus on the low level API but it uses it in several areas. This tutorial shows how to write an ETSF file with additional non-ETSF variables. These variables are defined and written directly by using the low level API.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>etsf_io (<em>libetsf_io.a</em>)</h3>
    <p>It is also made of one unique module, called <code>etsf_io</code>, containing specific routines to the ETSF specifications.</p>
    <div class="warning">Beware that the library built on that module includes the etsf_io_low_level module. This means that linking with <code>libetsf_io.a</code> implies linking with etsf_io_low_level.</div>
    <p>This module is the core of ETSF_IO. All variables from the specifications have been gathered into structured called <em>group</em> (see the etsf_groups <a href="group_level/etsf_io_f90.html#robo7">page</a> and related ones).</p>
    <p>For each group, one can define a file with these variables using methods with a name like <code>etsf_io_&lt;group_name&gt;_def()</code>. This will alocate the disk space required to store all the variables of the group. Then, to write data, methods called <code>etsf_io_&lt;group_name&gt;_put()</code> are available. For reading actions, the routines are suffixed with get instead of put. To access several groups at one time a high level routine has been created and is called <code>etsf_io_data_&lt;action&gt;</code>.</p>
    <p>There are three tutorials to learn how to use this module:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="tutorials/create_a_crystal_den_file_f90.html">Tutorial 1</a> is intended to explain the basics and the philosophy of this library. It details the first steps required to create a density file, using high level routines (<code>etsf_io_data_&lt;action&gt;</code>). It shows how to use the pointers and the unformatted ones (used to map any shape arrays between the ETSF definition and the main program memory).</li>
      <li><a href="tutorials/read_write_sub_access_f90.html">Tutorial 2</a> introduced the group level routines and explain how to access only sub part of arrays. This sub access is possible when one array has a dimension on spin or k points. Then one can access data for one k point or spin at a time. This is controlled by some attributes in the concerned groups, called <code>&lt;short_var_name&gt;__[spin|kpoint]_access</code>. In this tutorial a wave-function file is created and the coefficients of wave-functions are written for one k point at a time.</li>
      <li><a href="tutorials/MPI_output_of_a_density_f90.html">Tutorial 4</a> shows how to use the split definitions as defined in the specifications to handle MPI computations. This tutorial create a density file with a paralelisation on z planes.</li>
      <li><a href="tutorials/mix_ETSF_and_non_ETSF_f90.html">Tutorial 5</a> shows how to use the etsf_io_<group>_put() methods in the context of a concurrent list of ETSF and non-ETSF variables.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>etsf_io_file &amp; etsf_io_tools (<em>libetsf_io_utils.a</em>)</h3>
    <p>This library contains two modules, <code>etsf_io_file</code> which is dedicated to high level actions on ETSF files (merge, check...) and <code>etsf_io_tools</code> which implements some not mandatory routines but convenient to handle data from ETSF files (get element names...).</p>
    <p><b>etsf_io_file</b> is a not mandatory high level module. It contains several routines to do complex action on ETSF files (see the API <a href="utils/etsf_io_file_f90.html">page</a>):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The merge routine can read several ETSF files and create a new one, copying all varaibles that are not splitted and merging those that have a split definition. If there is not enough input file to create a full unsplitted array, the new file will contains some new split informations resulting from the merge. This routine has currently some drawbacks: headers and attributes are lost, but all none-ETSF variables and dimensions are kept.</li>
      <li>The contents routine is used to get the specifications the file is matching and reasons why it fails on some.</li>
      <li>The check routine is used to validate the file on themes as defined in the specifications.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>etsf_io_tools</b> is a not mandatory high level module. TODO write something here.</p>
    <p>There is one tutorial to illustrate usage of these modules:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="convert_to_xyz_f90.html">Tutorial 3</a> shows how to use high level modules <a href="../utils/etsf_io_file_f90.html">etsf_io_file</a> and <a href="../utils/etsf_io_tools_f90.html">etsf_io_tools</a> to check the conformance of an input ETSF file on cristalographic specifications and then to read atomic coordinates and names to create a simple XYZ file.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>The support for attributes as defined in the specifications is transparent for the user of the library:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The units attribute is defined by default to "atomic units". When a file is read, all returned values are automatically converted to atomic units when required, thanks to the scale_to-atomic_units attribute. To get the true value from the file, one can give an optional argument to prevent to convert into atomic units, called <em>use_atomic_units</em> (logical).</li>
      <li>The k_dependent attribute is set to "yes" by default. When a variable with the k_dependent attribute is read, the value from the array is read except if the attribute is false. Then the fallback value specified in the ETSF specifications is given.</li>
      <li>The symmorphic attribute is set to "no" automatically as soon as reduced_symmetry_translations is set to non zero values.</li>
    </ul>
