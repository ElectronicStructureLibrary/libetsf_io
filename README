ETSF_IO is a library build on top of NetCDF that gives easy access to files
conforming to the ETSF specifications (see http://www.etsf.eu/specifications).
NetCDF files are binary files with key-values access, optimized to store
large volume of data. The ETSF specifications define all key-value pairs that
are normalized for a file containing informations of an electronic calculation.

This library is available in Fortran90 (and a coming day in C). It gives three
level access on files:
- the low level (see etsf_io_low_level module). It is a generic API to access NetCDF
  files, with less capabilities than the NetCDF API, but with all in one methods and
  dimension checkings. For instance etsf_io_low_read_var will read a var, knowing its
  name, checking that provided dimensions and shape are compatible with the definition
  of the variable in the NetCDF file.
- the group level (see etsf_io, which is the main part indeed). In the ETSF
  specifications, variables are gathered by groups. With this API, one to all
  groups can be read or write at once, giving a complete structure to store data.
- the utility level (see etsf_io_file and etsf_io_tools modules) with incorporated
  high level handling routines like file merging, validation checkers... There is also
  here a command line program to access all these utilities.

Please see the files in the doc/www directory for documentation of the API, browsable
with a web browser (use doc/www/index.html).
See also the doc/www/tutorials/index.html directory for indications on how to use the
library in an other program (link on it, examples of low level access or group
level access).

Please see the file COPYING for copying conditions.

See the file INSTALL for generic compilation and installation instructions.
In addition to the usual configure options ETSF_IO requires the pathes to the  
netcdf library to be specified.

  --with-netcdf-module-path
                          Give the path of the NetCDF Fortran90 module
                          (default = /usr/include).
  --with-netcdf-ldflags   
                          Give the flags required to link with the NetCDF
                          library (default is -L/usr/lib).


The main targets in the top Makefile are:
- make, to build the library and the tests executables.
- make check, to run all incorporated unitary tests.
- make install, to install the program
